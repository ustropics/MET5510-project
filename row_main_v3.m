% Filename: row_main.m

% Description: Script for setting up the Rossby wave model in the 
% quasi-geostrophic framework, initializing grid parameters, computing 
% the mean zonal wind (Ubar) and PV gradient (BPVy), constructing matrices 
% (B, C, D) for PV inversion and advection, and solving the eigenvalue 
% problem to determine wave stability, saving results to 
% 'data/rossby_wave_#.mat'.

% Functions used: 
% - l2jk: Converts linear index to 2D indices (j, k).
% - jk2l: Converts 2D indices (j, k) to linear index.
% - stream2pv: Computes potential vorticity from streamfunction.
% - stream2xPVadv: Calculates zonal advection of potential vorticity.
% - stream2yPVadv: Computes meridional advection of potential vorticity.
% - eig: Performs eigenvalue decomposition.
