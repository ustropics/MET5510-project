% FILENAME: XV2streamxtime.m

% DESCRIPTION: Converts the 1D eigenvector (XV) into a streamfunction field 
% varying with longitude and time, tracking wave propagation in 
% the quasi-geostrophic model.

% INPUT:
% - XV: Eigenvector representing the streamfunction
% - ii: Number of grid points in the x-direction
% - dx: Grid spacing in the x-direction
% - omega: Growth rate from eigenvalues
% - ylat: Latitude index
% - zlev: Height index

% OUTPUT:
% - xtime: 2D array representing the streamfunction field over longitude and time

% MATH/FUNCTIONS: ψ(x,t) = XV * exp(i(kx - ωt))

% - VARIABLES:
%   - k is wavenumber
%   - ω is growth rate from eigenvalues
%   - x is longitude
%   - t is time
