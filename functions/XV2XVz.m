% FILENAME: XV2XVz.m

% DESCRIPTION: Computes the z-derivative (vertical) of the 1D eigenvector (XV) 
% to derive the vertical component of the streamfunction gradient in the 
% quasi-geostrophic model. This function is used to calculate temperature or 
% vertical velocity fields, critical for analyzing thermal structures and vertical 
% motion in wave dynamics and perturbation evolution within the QG framework.

% INPUT:
% - XV: 1D array representing the streamfunction eigenvector (m²/s), with length ll

% OUTPUT:
% - XVz: 1D array representing the vertical derivative of the streamfunction 
%        (m/s), with length ll

% MATH/FUNCTIONS: XVz = ∂XV/∂z

% - VARIABLES:
%   - Interior points: ∂XV/∂z = (XV(j,k+1) - XV(j,k-1)) / (2 * dz)
%   - Bottom boundary (k=1): ∂XV/∂z = (XV(j,2) - XV(j,1)) / dz
%   - For top boundary (k=kk+1): ∂XV/∂z = (XV(j,kk+1) - XV(j,kk)) / dz
%   - dz: Vertical grid spacing (m)
%   - The derivative is computed using centered finite differences for interior 
%     points and one-sided differences at boundaries
