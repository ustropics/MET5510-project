% Description: BPVY computes the background potential vorticity 
% gradient (dPV/dy)for Rossby, Eady, or HWME models.

% Inputs:
% - model - 'Rossby', 'Eady', or 'HWME'
% - jj: Number of latitude grid points
% - kk: Number of height grid points
% - beta: Planetary vorticity gradient (m^-1 s^-1)
% - Ubar: Mean zonal wind field (jj+1 x kk+1 array, m/s)
% - dy: Meridional grid spacing (m)
% - f0: Coriolis parameter (s^-1)
% - NN2: Brunt-Vaisala frequency squared (s^-2)
% - dz: Vertical grid spacing (m)

%  Output:
% - BPVy - background PV gradient field
