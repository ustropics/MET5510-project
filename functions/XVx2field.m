% FILENAME: XVx2field.m

% Description: Converts the x-derivative of the eigenvector (XVx) into a 
% 3D meridional wind field over the grid in the quasi-geostrophic model, 
% accounting for geostrophic balance.

% INPUT:
% - XV: Eigenvector representing the streamfunction
% - ii: Number of grid points in the x-direction
% - dx: Grid spacing in the x-direction

% OUTPUT:
% - field: 3D array representing the meridional wind field

% MATH/FUNCTIONS: v' = (g/f₀) ∂ψ/∂x

% - VARIABLES:
%   - ψ is streamfunction
%   - g is gravity
%   - f₀ is Coriolis parameter
%   - ∂/∂x is derived from XVx
