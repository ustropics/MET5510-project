% FILENAME: plot_gph_top.m

% DESCRIPTION: Plots the geopotential height contour at the top boundary
% (k=kk+1) across longitude and latitude, and saves it as an image.

% INPUT:
% - xx: Longitude coordinates (degrees)
% - yy: Latitude coordinates (degrees)
% - gpt_h: Geopotential height field (ii+1 x jj+1 x kk+1 array, m)

% OUTPUT:
% - Saves plot to 'output/figures/gph_top.png'
