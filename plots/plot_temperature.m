% FILENAME: plot_temperature.m

% DESCRIPTION: Plots the temperature contour at a specified vertical level
% across longitude and latitude, and saves it as an image, including hlevel in title and filename.

% INPUT:
% - xx: Longitude coordinates (degrees)
% - yy: Latitude coordinates (degrees)
% - temp: Temperature field (ii+1 x jj+1 x kk+1 array, K)
% - hlevel: Vertical level index (e.g., 1, 25, 51) for title, filename, and data slice
% - model: Model name for filename
% - m0: Wavenumber for filename
% - n_mode: Mode number for filename
% - fig_path: Directory path for saving figure

% OUTPUT:
% - Saves plot to 'fig_path/model_temperature_nmode-n_mode_m0-m0_hlevel-hlevel.png'
