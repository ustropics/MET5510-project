% DESCRIPTION: Plots the potential vorticity contour at the surface (k=1)
% across longitude and latitude, and saves it as an image.

% INPUT:
% - xx: Longitude coordinates (degrees)
% - yy: Latitude coordinates (degrees)
% - pvfield: Potential vorticity field (ii+1 x jj+1 x kk+1 array, s^-1)

% OUTPUT:
% - Saves plot to 'output/figures/pvfield.png'
