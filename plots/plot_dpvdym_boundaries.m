% FILENAME: plot_dpvdym_boundaries.m

% DESCRIPTION: Plots d(PVbar)/dy at the surface, troposphere mid-level, and with
% beta effect at boundaries, with latitude on the x-axis and d(PVbar)/dy values
% on the y-axis, and saves it as an image.

% INPUT:
% - yy: Latitude coordinates (degrees)
% - BPVy: Meridional gradient of background PV (jj+1 x kk+1 array, s^-1)
% - beta: Beta parameter (m^-1 s^-1)
% - kk: Number of height grid points

% OUTPUT:
% - Saves plot to 'output/figures/dpvdym_boundaries.png'
