This directory contains the files and code for Grace and Matthew's MET5510 project under the guidance of Dr. Cai and Dr. Sun.

## Project Overview
The program simulates various atmospheric wave patterns using different modeling techniques for mid-latitude systems. Currently, simulations can be run for
